# LI2-PL5G05

### Final Grade: 19/20

Implementation of an interpreter for a stack oriented programming language called __$OM__.

This group project was fully developed in __C__ during the second semester of the Computer Science and Engineering degree at UMinho. The full process of development was evaluated and established the final grade for the "Laboratórios de Informática II" subject.

## Installing and running the program

The interpreter can receive inputs using a specific sintax that is explained in deitail here, therefore it works like a calculator with some extra functionality. Here's how to try it out on your Linux machine:

### Dependencies

Have in mind that this project was fully developed in C, which means a C compiler is needed to compile and run the program. Namely **gcc** that can be installed very easily using your favorite package manager. Here's how it goes for Manjaro Linux using *pamac*:

```bash
$ sudo pamac install gcc
```

### Cloning the repository

Time to clone the repository, run the following command or simply donwload and extract the .zip file to your home.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sassypocoyo/LI2-PL5G05.git
```

### Compiling and running

To compile the project, first let's move to the repository we just cloned/downloaded:

```bash
$ cd LI2-PL5G05/src
```

Then, run the compilation script by doing:

```bash
$ ./comp
```

Your done, now you just need to run the following command everytime you want to run the program.

```bash
$ ./proj
```

### Have fun!
